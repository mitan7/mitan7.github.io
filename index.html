    <h1>By MITAN</h1>
    <p>You were just hacked. Like... big time. I have alot on this current device! Like a RAT, Keylogger, heavy persistence, and even admin! Can you beleive it? I bet you can't. But anyway, the reason I am informing you is simply: I got bored. Literally. bordem. I already stole everything, do not worry! But yeah, have fun.</p>
